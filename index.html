Its architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines, from China and from Europe, resulting in a culture and townscape that have no parallel anywhere in East and South-East Asia.</p>
                                <p>The two storey structures are built of brick and wood, with a steeply pitched roof reminiscent of traditional Chinese architecture. The exterior walls of the upper storey are enclosed by window panels of kapis shells framed in wood which can be slid back for better ventilation. Most of the existing buildings were probably built in the mid 18th to late 19th centuries. </p>

                                <p>Mt. Pinatubo was considered as the second largest and one of the most catastrophic volcanic eruptions of the 20th century causing deaths of a thousand. The 1991 volcanic eruption has a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6 which altered its landscape and discharged ashes. It covered the entire Luzon and even reached neighboring Asian countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Nestled at the tripoint boundary of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga, Mt. Pinatubo is an active volcano that has a towering range of 4,757 feet high. The famous volcano gained its popularity in its 1991 eruption. Today, it has become one of the most popular travel destinations in the country. Despite its tragic past, the beauty of Mt. Pinatubo is a sight to behold.

                                <p>The 1991 caldera afterwards filled with water from annual monsoon rains and a crater lake, Lake Pinatubo, was formed. In 1992, a growing lava dome formed an island, which was eventually submerged by the lake. Initially, the lake was hot and highly acidic, with a minimum pH of 2 and a temperature of about 40 °C (104 °F). Subsequent rainfall cooled and diluted the lake, lowering the temperature to 26 °C (79 °F) and raising the pH to 5.5 by 2003.

                                <p>
                                    The lake deepened by about 1 meter (3.3 ft) per month on average, eventually submerging the lava dome, until September 2001, when fears that the walls of the crater might be unstable prompted the Philippine government to order a controlled draining of the lake. An estimated 9,000 people were once again evacuated from surrounding areas in case a large flood was accidentally triggered. Workers cut a 5-meter (16 ft) notch in the crater rim and drained about a quarter of the lake's volume.

                                <p>The Chocolate Hills form a rolling terrain of haycock-shaped hills – mounds of a generally conical and almost symmetrical shape. Estimated to be from 1,268 to about 1,776 individual mounds, these cone-shaped or dome-shaped hills are actually made of grass-covered limestone. The domes vary in sizes from 30 to 50 metres (98 to 164 ft) high with the largest being 120 metres (390 ft) in height. One of Bohol's best known tourist attractions, these unique mound-shaped hills are scattered by the hundreds throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan in Bohol

                                <p>
                                    During the dry season, the grass-covered hills dry up and turn chocolate brown. This transforms the area into seemingly endless rows of Hershey's "chocolate kisses". The branded confection is the inspiration behind the name, Chocolate Hills.

                                <p>There are 1,247 hills, of which two have been developed into tourist resorts. 
                                    The main viewing point of the Chocolate Hills is the government-owned Chocolate Hills Complex in Carmen, Bohol, about 55 km (34 miles) from the regional capital Tagbilaran. The other main point to view the Chocolate Hills is at Sagbayan Peak, in Sagbayan, 18 km (11 miles) away from the Chocolate Hills complex in neighboring Carmen.

The front gateway façade measures 40 feet (12 m) high being in the south wall and facing the city. The communication with the river and the sea was by an obscure postern gate - the Postigo de la Nuestra Señora del Soledad (Postern of Our Lady of Solitude). Inside the fort were guard stations, together with the barracks of the troops of the garrison and quarters of the warden and his subalterns. Also inside the fort were various storehouses, a chapel, the powder magazine, the sentry towers, the cisterns, etc.

                                <p>The Tubbataha Reef is situated on the Cagayan Ridge, composing of extinct underwater volcanoes. Being a true atoll structure, it is believed that the atolls of Tubbataha were formed thousands of years ago as fringing reefs and volcanic islands. This is based on Charles Darwin's theory that atolls are formed when a volcano erupts and afterwards an island is born. When the volcanoes became extinct and the islands subsided over a long time, only the corals remain, growing towards the sunlight. The very big corals seen today surrounding the lagoons are originally the fringing reefs.

                                    The word tubbataha is a combination of two Sama-Bajau words: tubba and taha, which together means "a long reef exposed at low tide".

                                <p>In December 1993, the UNESCO declared the Tubbataha Reefs National Park as a World Heritage Site as a unique example of an atoll reef with a very high density of marine species; the North Islet serving as a nesting site for birds and marine turtles. The site is an excellent example of a pristine coral reef with a spectacular 100-m perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands. In 1999, Ramsar listed Tubbataha as one of the Wetlands of International Importance. In 2008, the reef was nominated at the New 7 Wonders of Nature.

                                <p>If you seek a picture-perfect beach characterized by white sand and coconut trees, Entalula Island ticks all the boxes. Don't leave your snorkeling gear behind when you visit this island, or you'll miss the colorful coral reefs and exotic fish just offshore. Even kids and weak swimmers will find swimming enjoyable in the blue, calm waters. Adventure-seekers may also explore the limestone cliff for low-level rock climbing. Keep in mind that only part of the beach is open to the public.

                                <p>After the Fernandez family sold the island to the Ayala’s, the island — save a small portion on the eastern part of the area — has become a private destination exclusive only to guests of the El Nido Resort. This island is one of El Nido’s most accessible destination — only an hour away from El Nido and 25-minutes away from Miniloc Island — where tourists can enjoy the island’s 250-metre stretch of powder white sand and breathtaking coral reefs. Like El Nido’s other destinations, Entalula Island is nothing short of panoramic — the pristine blue waters set against the towering marble black caves make for a perfect postcard photo.
